# MAVlink Utilities

A helper layer on top of MAVLink for performing common commands and tasks with one or more remote Ardupilot
vehicles. It can either be used as an API or directly from iex with an experience similar to Ardupilot's MAVProxy.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `mavlink_util` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mavlink_util, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
